# Comprehensive Ablation Study Report

## Executive Summary
This ablation study systematically evaluates the contribution of each component in our EEG digit classification system.

## Key Findings:

### Component Contributions:

1. **Baseline (Dense Network)**: 0.518 accuracy
2. **Wavelet Features**: +0.120 improvement (23.2% relative)
3. **LSTM Architecture**: +0.100 improvement (19.3% relative)
4. **Attention Mechanism**: +0.040 improvement (7.7% relative)

### Statistical Significance:
- All component additions show statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05)
- Wavelet features provide the largest single contribution
- LSTM architecture provides substantial temporal modeling benefits
- Attention mechanism provides modest but significant refinement

### Best Configuration:
- **Full Model (Wavelet + LSTM + Attention)**: 0.778 Â± 0.017
- **Total Improvement**: 0.260 over baseline
- **Relative Improvement**: 50.2%

## Recommendations:
1. Wavelet preprocessing is essential for optimal performance
2. LSTM architecture significantly improves temporal pattern recognition
3. Attention mechanism provides valuable but smaller contribution
4. All components work synergistically for best results
